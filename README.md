# What's this then?

This is an assignment from a software development course I'm doing at the moment.

It's an exercise to practice testing, and demonstrate an understanding of how to use both static and dynamic testing to debug broken code. The task is laid out in task.md, and the corrected code (and tests I wrote) are in the subdirectories associated with the two parts of the task set.
